# Project: Task Manaement Application

#### Step 1: Set Up Your Project
1. Create a new Flutter project for the frontend.
2. Set up a new Node.js project for the backend.
3. Create a DynamoDB table to store tasks.

#### Step 2: Flutter Frontend
4. Design a simple UI for the task management app with Flutter.
5. Implement functionality to fetch tasks from the backend.
6. Display the list of tasks on the app.
7. Add the ability to create a new task.
8. Implement task editing and deletion.

#### Step 3: Node.js Backend
9. Set up Express.js for your Node.js backend.
10. Implement API endpoints for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for tasks.
11. Connect your backend to DynamoDB to store and retrieve tasks.

#### Step 4: Connect Frontend and Backend
12. Update your Flutter app to make API calls to your Node.js backend.
13. Ensure data synchronization between the frontend and backend.

#### Step 5: Testing
14. Write unit tests for critical components in both Flutter and Node.js.
15. Test the integration between the frontend and backend.

#### Step 6: Deployment
16. Deploy your Node.js backend on a server or a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Heroku).
17. Deploy your Flutter app on a mobile device or an emulator.

#### Step 7: Additional Features (Optional)
18. Add user authentication for securing task data.
19. Implement task categories or tags.
20. Enable task sorting and filtering options.

#### Step 8: Documentation and Refinement
21. Document your code and project setup.
22. Refine the UI and user experience.
23. Optimize and refactor your code where necessary.

### Notes:
- Throughout the process, you'll need to handle errors and edge cases gracefully.
- Don't forget to handle loading states and provide feedback to the user.
- Use proper error handling and logging in your backend.

This project should provide a hands-on experience with your chosen stack, covering frontend development with Flutter, backend development with Node.js and Express, and database management with DynamoDB. Adjust the complexity based on your timeframe and prior experience with the technologies.

### List of features for your Task Management Application, broken down into manageable steps for a 20 to 40-hour timeframe:

#### Basic Features (20-40 hours):

1. **Task List Display (4 hours):**
   - Display a list of tasks on the app's home screen.
   - Each task should show its title and due date.

2. **Add Task (4 hours):**
   - Implement a form to add a new task with a title and due date.
   - Validate input and show appropriate messages.

3. **Edit Task (4 hours):**
   - Allow users to edit existing tasks.
   - Update the task information in the UI and backend.

4. **Delete Task (3 hours):**
   - Enable users to delete tasks.
   - Confirm deletion with a dialog.

5. **Backend API for CRUD Operations (8 hours):**
   - Set up API routes for creating, reading, updating, and deleting tasks.
   - Connect to DynamoDB for data storage.

#### Intermediate Features (Additional 10-15 hours):

6. **Cross-device Data Synchronization (4 hours):**
   - Ensure that tasks added or modified on one device reflect on others.
   - Use a simple sync mechanism or real-time updates.

7. **User Authentication (5 hours):**
   - Implement a basic user authentication system.
   - Allow only authenticated users to add, edit, or delete tasks.

8. **Task Categories or Tags (4 hours):**
   - Allow users to categorize tasks with tags or categories.
   - Filter tasks based on categories.

#### Advanced Features (Additional 5-10 hours):

9. **Sorting and Filtering (4 hours):**
   - Implement options to sort tasks by due date or category.
   - Allow users to filter tasks based on different criteria.

10. **Testing (5 hours):**
    - Write unit tests for critical components in both Flutter and Node.js.
    - Perform integration testing between the frontend and backend.

11. **Documentation and Refinement (5 hours):**
    - Document your code, including API endpoints and data structures.
    - Refine the UI, add animations, and improve the user experience.

Feel free to adjust the features based on your priorities and available time. This breakdown should provide a structured approach to implementing key functionalities while allowing room for additional features and improvements as time permits.
